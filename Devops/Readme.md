Can you explain the process and advantages of Continuous Integration and Delivery, and provide an example of a pipeline you've built for a complex project?

Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

In a previous project, we had developed a web application with microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes. Our CI/CD pipeline included the following steps:

Developers would write code in their respective feature branches.
Code would be merged into the development branch and run through unit tests initially in the CI process. Developers would receive comments and suggestions if tests fail or code breaks.
After code passes unit tests, it would be integrated with other development branches, and QA would be performed using automation testing tools, including Selenium and Cypress.
CD would automatically release the code to the staging environment after passing successful tests. This would be reviewed by business stakeholders or product owners to ensure that everything aligned with their requirements.
If approved, the code would be automatically released to the production environment.
This pipeline allowed us to deploy code changes smoothly and frequently while maintaining a high level of reliability and reducing the risk of deployment failures. Additionally, it helped us reduce manual testing time, saving our team time and resources.


Describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a complex issue in a production environment. Walk me through the steps you took to identify the root cause and how you resolved the issue. How did you communicate the resolution to the team and what steps did you take to prevent the issue from occurring in the future?

Can you explain the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, and how do they relate to each other in a DevOps environment?

Continuous delivery 
Automates the process of building, testing, and staging updates
Developers decide when to deploy a change to production
Ensures that changes are ready to be deployed to production
Allows for a business decision to be made about going live

Continuous deployment 
Automatically releases changes to production that pass all stages of the production pipeline
Eliminates the need for manual approval to update to production
Allows developers to focus on building software


what are some security practices in devops?
Managing secrets for tools like ansible and kubernetes using vault or secrets managet like kubeseal
scaning the code for vulnerablities using code scan tools like sonarqube and checkmarx
using hashicorp vault or cyberark for storing credentials 
using apitokens for connecting to artifactory and whereever possible
rotating passwords using password rotation policy
using ssh based connections to connect to agents
scan the docker images using scanners like trivy before uploading images and using them
